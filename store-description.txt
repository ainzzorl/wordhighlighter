The extension can be used to expand your vocabulary. When you learn a new word, add it to Word Highlighter, and you won't forget the word because it will be highlighted every time you encounter it.

Word Highlighter is smart about how it matches words on the page with words in the dictionary. It understands that "cherry" and "cherries", "aprender Español" and "aprendemos Español" are the same. Smart matching is supported in English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian and Swedish.
