* **Smart**. It understands that "cherry" and "cherries", "aprender Español" and "aprendemos Español" are the same.

* **Optimized for language learning**. Smart matching is supported in English, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian and Swedish. Divide words into groups when you learn several languages.
