# FAQ

## What is smart matching and how does it work?

Smart matching refers to the feature of Word Highlighter when it also highlights words derived from words in the dictionary. For instance, if you add the word *hood*, it will also highlight *hooded* or *hoodie*, but not *neighborhood*.

Smart matching is based on [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming).

## What can I do with Groups?

Groups allow you to customize the behavior for different collections of groups in your dictionary.

For example, if words in your dictionary come from different languages, it would make sense to create different groups per language and assign them different colors.

## What does the History tab do?

The History tab shows you how often you see each word. You can find out how common or uncommon each of them is on the websites you visit.

## What if I don't want Word Highlighter to run on some pages?

It can be configured in the Settings tab. There you list pages you don't want Word Highlighter to process, one per line. It supports simple wildcards: ? and *.

If you want Word Highlighter to run only on a few pages, set "Don't highlight on these pages" to *, and add pages to "Except on these pages".

You can also enable/disable Word Highlighter on different pages per Group in the Groups tab.
